# Airbnb-Booking-Analysis

Problem statement: Airbnb is an online marketplace that connects people who want to rent out their homes with people looking for accommodations in that locale. NYC is the most populous city in the United States, and one of the most popular tourism and business places globally. Airbnb would like to understand customers and provider’s behavior and performance on the platform, marketing initiatives, implementation of innovative additional services etc.

Data structure: The first step was to load the data which is acquired from AlmaBetter capstone project module. With that various necessary library were installed which might be helpful in executing our operations. The dataset contains around 49,000 observations and 16 columns. Dataset having categorical and numerical features contains null values in it. All null values and unwanted columns were removed which were of less importance.

Data analysis: Airbnb NYC dataset contains variables like price, room_type, neighborhood_group, neighborhood, host_id, availability_365 etc. The dataset values will help in the EDA visualization by giving an idea about top 10 most affluent host’s name, most preferred destinations in NY city, most visited neighbourhood, most and least expensive neighbourhood in Manhattan and Brooklyn, prices distribution with respect to the number of nights spent and people preference to stay at less neighbourhood. To visualize these various data, we used the help of count plot, bar plot, scatter plot, pie chart, etc. We used group by technique to merge various variables and understand them more deeply. We also used pivot table to arrange the dataframe of prices of room types in various neighbourhood groups.



Conclusion:

•	Sonder(NYC) and other nine is our top priority customer.

•	Most preferred destination is Manhattan and Brooklyn. 

•	Most booking is done in Williamsburg. From our research, we found that Williamsburg is famous for beaches and museums, so its quite evident that most people come here as recreational purposes.

•	From our analysis, people more likely to live in less expensive neighbourhood.
